# Quantum Compiler Challenge

The task is to build a compiler that can execute and interpret a quantum circuit and establish connectivity with the Quantum Device. A quantum circuit can contain several complicated elements such as the Toffoli gate which must be broken down into simpler operations before execution.

## Reuirements

This challenge doesn't require much of Quantum Computing itself. It is more related to knowing Python lists and functions. You are required to write a program that converts a given quantum circuit into a circuit that is executable on the quantum hardware.
